        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
          While we strive for 99.9% uptime, no digital service is immune to interruptions. <b>Zephyr Group</b> may experience scheduled downtimes for maintenance, performance upgrades, or server migrations. In the event of planned outages, we will notify users at least 24 hours in advance via email or dashboard alerts. During emergency updates, we work diligently to resolve issues as fast as possible while prioritizing data integrity.
          <br /><br />
          Our tools, simulations, and visualizations are subject to data availability from external systems, and we cannot be held responsible for inaccuracies arising due to API failures, broken links, or third-party data corruption. We strongly advise users not to rely solely on the platform for mission-critical power-related decisions without parallel cross-verification.
